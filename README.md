#Physics-Informed Neural Network for 2D Steady Navier–Stokes Equations

A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) implementation in TensorFlow for solving the 2D steady-state Navier–Stokes equations using the **stream function–pressure formulation**. This project trains the model using the **L-BFGS-B optimizer** and visualizes the resulting **u- and v-velocity fields**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how PINNs can be applied to simulate incompressible, steady-state fluid flows governed by the 2D Navier–Stokes equations. The implementation combines physics-based PDE loss terms with deep learning to approximate the stream function and pressure fields, from which the velocity components are derived.

## 🧮 Mathematical Formulation

The steady-state, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
u &= \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}, \quad
v = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \\
0 &= u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} - \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) \\
0 &= u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} - \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right)
\end{aligned}
\]

The stream function formulation automatically satisfies the continuity equation:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0
\]
